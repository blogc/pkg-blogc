.
.SH "NAME"
\fBblogc\-source\fR \- blogc\'s source file format
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Source files are used as input data to the blogc(1) compiler\. They provide variables and content, that are used by the compiler to fill the gaps available in the templates (see blogc\-template(7))\.
.
.P
The syntax of the source files is designed to be as simple as possible\. The variables are defined in the top of the file as key\-value lines, and the content is defined right after the variables\.
.
.P
Content is written in a markup language that is similar to John Gruber\'s Markdown, but that is NOT Markdown\. This language is very simple, while powerful enough to write big posts\.
.
.P
Content must be valid UTF\-8\.
.
.SH "SOURCE VARIABLES"
Variables are key\-value lines\. The variable name must be upper\-case, starting with a letter and following with one or more letters and/or underscores\. The value is separated from the variable name with a \':\' and finishes in the end of the line\. Multi\-line values are not supported\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

VARIABLE1: Value of variable one
VARIABLE2: Value of variable two

.P
All the variables defined in the source files are local and will override global variables provided to blogc(1) in the command\-line, but just inside blocks that handle local variables\. See blogc\-template(7) for details\.
.
.P
The \fBDATE\fR variable is special, and represents the publishing date of the post\. It may be formatted with the \fBDATE_FORMAT\fR variable, if provided, otherwise will be kept as is\. The proper way to access the date from the template is to use the \fBDATE_FORMATTED\fR variable, that will contain the formatted date, or the original date, depending on whether the \fBDATE_FORMAT\fR variable is provided or not\.
.
.P
The \fBDATE\fR variable should be in the following format: \fByyyy\-mm\-dd hh:mm:ss\fR\. You can omit seconds, minutes and hours if you want, they will be filled with \'0\'\. Allowed formats are \fByyyy\-mm\-dd hh:mm:ss\fR, \fByyyy\-mm\-dd hh:mm\fR, \fByyyy\-mm\-dd hh\fR and \fByyyy\-mm\-dd\fR
.
.P
The \fBDATE_FORMAT\fR variable should be passed to blogc(1) as a global variable\. Its value must be a valid strftime(3) format\.
.
.P
The source parser will also automatically generate a variable called \fBFILENAME\fR, that stores the name of the source file, without its extension\. This is useful for building permalinks in templates\. This variable can\'t be overriden by an explicit definition in source file\.
.
.P
The variable \fBFIRST_HEADER\fR is created by the source parser by default, containing the unparsed value of the first header found in the source file\. The content is not parsed but HTML entities are encoded\. Headers inside blockquotes are ignored\. This variable can be overriden by an explicit definition in source file, that must have the HTML entities escaped manually\.
.
.P
Another variable, \fBDESCRIPTION\fR, will be automatically created by the source parser\. It contains the unparsed content of the first paragraph found in the source file\. The content is not parsed but HTML entities are encoded\. Paragraphs inside blockquotes are ignored\. This variable can be overriden by an explicit definition in source file, that must have the HTML entities escaped manually\. This is useful to add "description" meta\-tags to HTML templates\. It may be needed to truncate the variable size to an maximum length, take a look at blogc\-template(7)\.

.P
Each header will have an \fBid\fR attribute, that is a lowercase version of the unparsed header title, with non\-alphanumeric characters replaced by \'\-\'\. These \fBid\fRs can be used to create anchor links to specific sections of your content\.
.
.SS "Blockquotes"
Blockquotes are defined with lines starting with \'>\' characters\. Content defined inside a blockquote is parsed again, so all the block elements are allowed inside blockquotes\. The indentation after the \'>\' character must be preserved in the begin of each blockquote line\.

.SS "Ordered Lists"
Ordered lists are defined with lines starting with a number and a \'\.\' character\. The indentation after the starting character must be preserved in the begin of each line, meaning that the content of the items must be aligned\. The order and value of the numbers is ignored\.

This is a paragraph before horizontal rule

***

This is a paragraph after horizontal rule
.

.P
The horizontal rule must not be on its own paragraph, otherwise it will be parsed as a continuation of the previous paragraph\.

.SS "HTML Blocks"
HTML blocks are paragraphs started with \'<\' character\. Everything is kept untouched in HTML blocks, until the next paragraph\.

.SS "Excerpt Separator"
The excerpt is separated from the full content of a page/post using a paragraph with a sequence of 2 or more \'\.\' characters\.
.
.P

.
.SH "SOURCE CONTENT \- INLINE ELEMENTS"

This is inline code: `code`

The later form is particularly useful when a \'`\' is part of the code, because escaping delimiters with \'\e\' is not possible\.
