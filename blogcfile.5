.SS "Settings"
blogc\-make(1) relies on a predefined set of rules to build the websites, however these rules can be customized with the following settings, from the \fB[settings]\fR section:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBatom_ext\fR (default: \fB\.xml\fR): The extension of the generated Atom feeds\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBatom_order\fR (default: \fBDESC\fR): The ordering (\fBASC\fR or \fBDESC\fR) of the Atom feeds\. Please note that the files are not sorted by date, they are sorted by their order in the \fB[posts]\fR section\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBatom_posts_per_page\fR (default: \fB10\fR): Number of posts per page in the Atom feeds\. If negative, all the posts are included\. If \fB0\fR, no Atom feeds are generated\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBatom_prefix\fR (default: \fBatom\fR): The prefix of the generated Atom feeds\. It is relative to the output directory\. With the default values of the settings, the main Atom feed will be \fBatom\.xml\fR, the Atom feed for the \fBfoo\fR tag will be \fBatom/foo\.xml\fR and so on\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBatom_template\fR (default: internal template) The template file that should be used when building Atom feeds\. This file is relative to \fBtemplate_dir\fR\. If not provided, an internal default template will be used instead\. The internal template can be dumped using the \fBatom_dump\fR blogc\-make(1) rule\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBcontent_dir\fR (default: \fBcontent\fR): The directory that stores the source files\. This directory is relative to \fBblogcfile\fR\.

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBhtml_ext\fR (default: \fB/index\.html\fR): The extension of the generated HTML files\. The default value will result on friendly URL, by creating directories with \fBindex\.html\fR files inside, instead of creating the HTML file directly\. The \fBindex\fR page is a special case: instead of generating something like \fB/index/index\.html\fR, it will generate \fB/index\.html\fR, because this is behavior that most users would expect\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBhtml_order\fR (default: \fBDESC\fR): The ordering (\fBASC\fR or \fBDESC\fR) of the posts in the listing indexes\. Please note that the files are not sorted by date, they are sorted by their order in the \fB[posts]\fR section\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBindex_prefix\fR (default: unset): The prefix of the index HTML page, that is the listing of blog posts\. This option is useful if the user wants to host a page in the root of the website, and move the posts listing index to a subdirectory\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBlisting_entry\fR (default: unset): The page that will be included in the listing pages of the website, without the page prefix and without the extension, only the "slug" should be used\. See blogc(1) and the description of \fBlisting_entry\fR block in blogc\-template(7) for details\.

.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBlocale\fR (default: unset): The locale to be used when calling blogc(1)\. E\.g\. \fBen_US\.UTF\-8\fR\.

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBpagination_prefix\fR (default: \fBpage\fR): The prefix of the generated pagination pages\. It is relative to the output directory\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBpost_prefix\fR (default: \fBpost\fR): The prefix of the posts file names\. It is used for both content and output directories, and is relative to \fBcontent_dir\fR and the output directory\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBposts_per_page\fR (default: \fB10\fR): Number of posts per page in the pagination pages\. If negative, all the posts are included\. If \fB0\fR, no post listing pages are generated\. Also, if negative or \fB0\fR, the \fBpagination\fR build rule is disabled\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBposts_sort\fR (default: \fBfalse\fR): If true, blogc(1) will sort the posts by date, despite the order of the posts in the \fB[posts]\fR section, in descending order\. This setting is compatible with \fBhtml_order\fR and \fBatom_order\fR settings, to control the order of the posts\.
.
